/// Used for creating traces and metrics for the application.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class is heavily inspired by the OpenTelemetry implementation in App.Lib.Core
/// This class holds all labels, metrics and trace datastructures for OTel based instrumentation.
/// There are a couple of reasons to do this:
/// * Decouple metric lifetime from the objects that use them (since they are often scoped/transient)
/// * Create a logical boundary to emphasize that telemetry and label names are considered public contract, subject to semver same as the rest of the code
/// * Reason being that users may refer to these names in alerts, dashboards, saved queries etc
/// * Minimize cluttering of "business logic" with instrumentation code
///
/// Watch out for high cardinality when choosing tags. Most timeseries and tracing databases
/// do not handle high cardinality well.
