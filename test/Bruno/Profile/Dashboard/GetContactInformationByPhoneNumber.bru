  ## Key Differences from Other Dashboard Endpoints
  
  | Aspect | This Endpoint | Other Dashboard Endpoints |
  |--------|---------------|---------------------------|
  | Data Source | User-registered contact info | External business registry |
  | Includes SSN/Name | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
  | User Count | Multiple users per org | N/A |
  | Timestamp | One per user entry | Registry update time |
  
  ## Authentication
  
  Requires Dashboard Maskinporten scope: `altinn:profile.support.admin`
  
  ## Parameters
  
  - `phoneNumber` (path): URL-encoded phone number to look up contact information for
  - `countrycode` (query): Country code prefix (default: "+47")
  
  ## Response Example
  
  ```json
  [
    {
      "nationalIdentityNumber": "01010112345",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "phone": "+4798765432",
      "organizationNumber": "123456789",
      "lastChanged": "2025-01-15T14:20:00Z"
    },
    {
      "nationalIdentityNumber": "01010198765",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
      "phone": "+4787654321",
      "organizationNumber": "987654321",
      "lastChanged": "2025-01-10T11:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
  ```
  
  ## Features
  
  - Returns all contactinformation who have registered contact info for the phone number
  - Each user can only have **one entry** per phone number per organization
  - organizationNumber indicates which organization the contact info is registered under
  - `nationalIdentityNumber` and `name` provide user identification
  - `lastChanged` applies to both email and phone (stored together)
  - Empty array if phone number exists but has no user contact info
  - Skips users whose profiles cannot be retrieved
  
  ## Status Codes
  
  - **200 OK**: Successfully retrieved user contact information (may be empty array)
  - **403 Forbidden**: Missing required scope
  - **404 Not Found**: Phone number doesn't exist
  
  ## Important Note
  
  The `lastChanged` timestamp is the same for email and phone because each user can only register one contact information entry per organization, consisting of email and phone stored together.
